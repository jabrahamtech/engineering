**Understanding modes, movements, and the core mental model.**

## 1. Vim’s Core Mental Model

Vim is built on three principles:

### Modal editing  
You switch between modes instead of holding modifier keys:
- `Normal` → navigate & operate  
- `Insert` → type text  
- `Visual` → select text  
- `Command` → run commands (`:`)

### Operators + Motions  
Everything is `operator + motion`:

| Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `d` | delete |
| `w` | word |
| `dw` | delete word |
| `ci(` | change inside parentheses |
| `yy` | yank line |

### Use your home row  
Movements avoid the arrow keys.

## 2. Modes

```
Normal  → press <Esc>
Insert  → i, I, a, A, o, O
Visual  → v (character), V (line), <Ctrl-v> (block)
Command → :
```

Common inserts:
```
i = insert before cursor  
I = insert at start of line  
a = append after cursor  
A = append at end of line  
o = open new line below  
O = open new line above
```

## 3. Navigation

### Basic:
```
h j k l   ← movement  
w / b     ← next/previous word  
0 / $     ← line start/end  
gg / G    ← file start/end  
```

### Jumps:
```
Ctrl-o     ← back  
Ctrl-i     ← forward  
```

### Searching:
```
/text     ← forward search  
?text     ← backward search  
n / N     ← next/previous match  
```

---

## 4. Operators

```
d = delete  
c = change (delete + insert)  
y = yank  
p = paste  
> = indent  
< = outdent
```

### Examples:
```
dw    delete word  
d$    delete to end of line  
caw   change a word  
yy    yank line  
p     paste below  
```

---

## 5. Counts (multipliers)

```
10j   move down 10  
3w    move 3 words  
5dd   delete 5 lines  
2p    paste twice  
```

---

## 6. Undo & Redo

```
u     undo  
Ctrl-r redo  
```

---

This gives you the base muscle memory required to use Vim comfortably.
