**Text objects, macro automation, global search, and structural editing.**

---

## 1. Text Objects (the real superpower)

Text objects allow editing by structure, not characters.

```
ciw   change inside word  
ci"   change inside quotes  
ci(   change inside parentheses  
da[   delete a bracket block  
vi'   visually select inside single quotes  
```

More:
```
i{ a{ i< a< i" a" i' a'
```

---

## 2. Search + Replace

### Basic single replace:
```
:s/old/new
```

### Replace all in file:
```
:%s/old/new/g
```

### With confirmation:
```
:%s/old/new/gc
```

### Use regex:
```
:%s/\d\+/-number-/g
```

---

## 3. Global editing

Run a command on all matching lines:
```
:g/pattern/d      delete lines  
:g/pattern/s/x/y  replace within matched lines  
```

---

## 4. Macros (recording)

### Record:
```
q<letter>
```

### Example (record in register "a"):
```
qa
```

### End:
```
q
```

### Play:
```
@a
```

### Repeat last macro:
```
@@
```

---

## 5. Multi-line operations

```
>G     indent to end of file  
<10j   outdent 10 lines  
!}fmt  format paragraph with external command
```

---

## 6. Buffers, Windows, Tabs

### Buffers
```
:ls          list  
:bp / :bn    prev/next  
:b <num>     go to buffer  
```

### Windows
```
:split  
:vsplit  
Ctrl-w h/j/k/l  navigate  
```

### Tabs
```
:tabnew  
:tabnext  
:tabclose  
```
