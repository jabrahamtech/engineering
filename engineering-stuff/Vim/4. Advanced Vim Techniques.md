**Registers, marks, jump lists, substitution tricks, structural editing, and speed patterns.**

## 1. Registers

Paste without overwriting:
```
"0p   paste last yanked
```

Named registers:
```
"aY   yank into register a  
"ap   paste register a  
```

Clipboard:
```
"+y   yank to system clipboard  
"+p   paste from system clipboard  
```

## 2. Marks

```
ma     mark location 'a'
`a     jump to mark  
'a     jump to line of mark  
```

Built-in marks:
```
``       ← last cursor location  
'.       ← last edited line  
```

## 3. Jump list

```
Ctrl-o   ← back  
Ctrl-i   → forward  
```

Good for navigating large files.

## 4. Structural editing using text objects

Some insanely powerful combos:

```
ci{   change inside braces  
da"   delete around quotes  
vat   visual select a html tag  
dit   delete inside tag  
```

For coding, this is unmatched.

## 5. Surround editing (requires plugin)

```
cs"'     change " → '  
ysiw"    wrap word in "

Jump to next result and center:

Use search results as motion:
```

## 7. Speed multipliers

```
f<char>   find char  
t<char>   find up to char  
;         repeat last find
